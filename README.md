In this project, I conducted survival analysis using R (rpart, ctree, and Cox Proportional Hazards Model) on a brain cancer patient dataset to identify key risk factos affecting survival time. I visualized survival curves and hazard functions to support medical decision-making, and demonstrated actuarial applications through risk-adjusted pricing and underwriting based on medical risk profiles using RStudio and Python.
